## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

**What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

In this project I was given the majority of the code setting up the maze parameters and the reward experience processing, which is the background setting for the Treasure Hunt Maze problem. What I created was the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm and the calls to the intelligent agent to analyze its performance after each epoch of training (where it looked at rewards and the past history to update the Q-table).

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientests use a wide variety of tools and methods to aalyze problems and figure out ways to solve them. Increasingly, this is involving using neural netowrks and learning algorthms to make decisions and optimize tasks. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist, when I approach a problem I like to get as much information about the problem as possible, and then I check and see if I can pull advice from others who have had this (or a similar) problem in the past. I think it's important to consider that the breadth of knowledge in any science is incredible, and we're all standing on the shoulders of giants so to speak, so someone elses experiences might be able to help inform my methods for solving a problem. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

My ethical responsbilities are largely to do no harm and to respect the privacy of the end user, and the integrity of the organization. The first apsect is really important when we consider problem0solving using an AI driven approach, because the models are only as good as the algorithms we use and the data we train them on, it is imporant to be broad and inclusive when using an AI for anything that involves people.
